Drupal Default Make File
========================

This is a simple project that stores a "default" make file for Drupal installations.
With this make file you will not have to download every time modules and dependencies,
but this make have many useful modules (modules that we consider useful).

Modules are categorized, so it's simple to search and add modules, libraries or themes.
Contributors should add short descriptions so will be possible to understand
what a module does.
