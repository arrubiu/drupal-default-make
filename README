Drupal Default Make File
========================

This is a simple project that stores a "default" make file for Drupal 7 installations.
With this make file you will not have to download every time modules and dependencies,
but this make have many useful modules (modules that we consider useful).

Modules are categorized, so it's simple to search and add modules, libraries or themes.
Contributors should add short descriptions so will be possible to understand
what a module does.


Instructions
============

To add items please follow this rules:

 - always search and use the right category for the item
 - don't leave empty lines betweens items
 - don't insert too long descriptions or break it in more lines, if necessary
 - use only english
 - don't insert version number
 - add an evident comment if a module is in DEV status or is signed as "yellow"
